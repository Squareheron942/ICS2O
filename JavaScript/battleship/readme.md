# Multiplayer Battleship Game

## Getting Started

### 1. Connecting to other players

- Create an ID. A prompt should appear upon load asking you to enter an ID. If you leave this empty, press "cancel" or use a non-alphanumeric character (which are not supported), then it will automatically generate an ID for you.

- Press the "connect" button, then enter the ID of the person against which you wish to play. As long as they accept within 7 seconds, they will automatically be connected as well. 

- Now, you can place your pieces. Press 'R' to rotate the piece you're holding, or press 'Enter' to place it. Once you have placed all 5 pieces, you can now click the "Send Board" button which should be enabled and once you do, you just have to wait! Once the other player is finished placing their pieces, it will automatically submit it and the game now starts!
