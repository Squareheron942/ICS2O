    <h3><b>This will be your heading</b></h3>
    <br>
    Then, you start talking about some interesting stuff that nobody wants to read, and in the middle of the text you <br> want to highlight a <b> strong statement that will blow everybody's mind </b> using bold text. Then you can quote <br> someone to add credibility: 
    <br>
    <i> A quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble of thinking for oneself, always a laborious <br> business. 
    <br>
    <h4><b> -T. Milne, If I May </b></h4></i>
    <br>
    Finally you can have some bullets to summarize everything, after all, new generations have this things in common: 
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Don't like to read long texts.</li>
      <li>Have the attention span of a: 
        <ol type="a">
          <li>bird</li>
          <li>cat 
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
              <li>paw</li>
              <li>tail</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Skip long paragraphs straight to the bullet points.</li>
    </ol>
